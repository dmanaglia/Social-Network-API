# Social-Network-API
  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

  ## Description
  
  This application is merely the backend of a potential social network application. It contains simple CRUD methods for users, thoughts and reactions. Using an IDE such as insomnia, we are able to test the application's backend functionality. The API requires a connection to a mongodb Database which I have named SocialNetworkDB, this can be updated in the connection.js file.
